# DCRYPT

This is a web app game where players can send and receive encrypted messages and decrypt them for point values.

The maximum number of guesses is 10.  Scoring is based on how many guesses it takes to solve the encrypted message.

A message, whether decrypted or not, can be deleted by the Sender.

Access to both Intercepted Messages (those received) and Messages Transmitted is given to the user.  Messages Transmitted by the user will indicate the status of the solving effort by the receiver.

MEAN Stack was used for this project:  MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS.  PassportJS was used for the authentication and JSON Web Tokens are used to track whether or not a user is signed in.
